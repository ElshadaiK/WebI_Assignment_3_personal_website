			I can't think when I'm alone. I really don't know why but to get things going upstairs there needs to be someone or something I can think with.I have always been like this; if, for example, a human isn't available and my dog is too busy licking his parts to be of any use, I split into two and argue with myself. Doing so in the streets forces my neighbors to change lanes in fear I might attempt to wear my shoes on my ears or something. Mental instability - in the eyes of the neighbors - is a price I usually pay for thinking. 
			This means I have limited access to my thoughts. I get only a glimpse while the rest has to be squeezed out of me. A particularly interesting squeeze came from a conversation with my best friend from college.  <br> "Everything here feels wrong, girl; nothing is done the right way," she said predicting my question.<br> "You mean your way? You have always been like this Hannah. You expect the world around you to follow your template of reality: correcting and controlling everything around you," I said motioning her to sit in fear she might physically fall apart any minute. <br>"I guess you're right," she said desperately trying to keep her red-shot eyes from closing. "I do go around hammering in anything that is out of place." <br>
			Right about then I felt I should say something wise. "I am sure you would be a whole lot better off if you just let the world be." I copied Gil Frondsal - my Zen teacher.<br>     
			"I can't. I simply can't." She said in a hopeless manner. I wanted to help but didn't know how to. How do you tell someone that has a deep predilection for ordering the world around him to embrace chaos? I decided to give it a try and worry about the details later.<br>   
			"But you know you would never succeed, right?" I said hoping she would tell me that she already knows. But she didn't. Instead she asked the question I still didn't have an answer to.  
			"Why won't I?" She asked me defiantly. <br> <br><img src="./assets/images/door.jpg" alt="" width="50%"><br><br>
			I couldn't think of any reason why she wouldn't. It all seemed like nothing more than a failed attempt at psychotherapy. But then I said something that surprised both me and her. <br>
			"Physics"  <br>
			 Though I didn't know where I was going with it, I decided to hear myself out â€“ to be my own audience.     
			"How?" she replied unsure.<br>      
			"The universe tends to go from order to disorder following the path that requires the least amount of energy. Which means chaos is a fundamental property of the universe. It is possibly the only unbreakable law in Physics. So any attempts you make to order the world around you will fail - no matter your efforts." <br>  
			<br><img src="./assets/images/door.jpg" alt="" width="50%"><br><br>
   
			It was only later that I realized I wasn't responsible for the Physicist-life coach lecture I did earlier. The conversation itself drew the ideas out from the dusty cauldrons they are stored in and string them together to make sense as a whole. I had no idea I was thinking it until it came out of me. I was, in effect, another audience to my own thoughts. It must've been my subconscious' doing in an effort to come up with a valid solution to Hannah's problem. Conversations like this are the maps of my own thinking spread across space and time, and the people that initiate them - Hannah, teachers, parents, and my imaginary friend that goes split when I'm alone - portals into my own mind.<br></div></td></tr></table>
