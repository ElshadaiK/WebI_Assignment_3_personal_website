			I have always loved to teach. Writing on my blackboard is not a mere hobby but it is a part of me. A passion of educating turned to so much more with a simple trip to Muketuri, one of the rural cities of Ethiopia.<br>
 The scenery was beautiful,the air refreshing. But I never felt peace on my trip. Being only the 2nd generation educated woman in my family, I was no stranger to the long practiced tradition of treating women as inferior. But this was different. In this day and age, it was excruciating to walk down the streets of that city and see girls of my age as mothers, wives, and puppets of the society that has paralyzed and deprived them of their ability to dream.<br>
I vowed right there that my life's mission would be to rescue my fellow sister from any one robbing her of her purpose. That day I started "project chalk the talk". It isn't a funded project or a movement spread to many. It simply is the principle and purpose of my life. Many acknowledge and strive to solve inequality in the world. With my project, I say that the answer begins from a simple chalk. By means of education I aspire to balance the scale and eradicate girls' supposed inferiority.<br>
  <br>
  We, our daughters and grand- daughters are going to be leaders, scientists, entrepreneurs or house wives as we wish to direct our lives. But we direct our ship; no one else. In my mission I write women's voices with my chalk. Storms of stereotypes and a world that considers being a girl and being human as flip side images of a coin, threaten our ship's voyage to equality.<br>
  My dream is use my chalkboard to defeat these storms .A chalk isn't a simple chalk to me anymore. It is my weapon, my voice, my asylum and the reason I fit. A baton of wisdom will be passed on to guarantee our freedom. <br>
